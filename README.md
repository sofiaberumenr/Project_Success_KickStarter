# Kickstarter Project Prediction

## Task 1 – Classification Model
Build a classification model using the Kickstarter dataset to predict whether a project's state is "successful" or "failed."

- The model must reflect predictions at the time of project launch. That means only predictors available at launch can be used.
- After finalizing your model:
  - Explain your model's logic.
  - Justify which predictors you included or excluded.

## Task 2 – Clustering Model
Build a clustering model to group projects into meaningful clusters.

- Once clusters are formed:
  - Describe the characteristics of each cluster.
  - Provide insights into what these groupings reveal.
